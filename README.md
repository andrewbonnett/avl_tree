# avl-tree
Lab for my CS 235 (Data Structures) class to gain a better understanding of the AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) Tree.

## Description
This lab assignment implements the AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
